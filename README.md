# Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning
This project aims to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using different machine learning techniques. We will be using the Breast Cancer dataset taken from kaggle, which contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass and corresponding diagnosis (malignant or benign).
# Getting Started
1.	Install the necessary libraries.
2.	Download the dataset and save it as data.csv in the project's root directory.
# Exploratory Data Analysis
Before we begin building our machine learning models, let's explore the dataset to gain some insights and preprocess the data if necessary. Here are some of the things we'll be doing in the EDA:
+  Visualize the distributions of the features
+  Compute the correlation matrix between the features etc.
Check out the colab notebook for more details on our exploratory data analysis.
# Machine Learning Techniques
We will be using the following machine learning techniques to predict the diagnosis of the breast tumors:
 + Random Forest
 + Support Vector Machines
# Conclusion
In this project, we used different machine learning techniques to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset. We performed exploratory data analysis to preprocess the data and gain some insights, built and trained the models using random forest and support vector machines, and evaluated their performance. We hope that this project can be useful for students and begginers. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to us.
